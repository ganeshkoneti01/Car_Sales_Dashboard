## Introduction
This Power BI dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of car sales data for the years 2022 and 2023. The dashboard tracks overall sales trends, car brand performance, and monthly sales variations. It is designed to offer insights into the reasons behind the significant sales decline in 2023, helping stakeholders make informed decisions to improve future performance.

## Problem Statement
The project aims to analyze and compare car sales data for 2022 and 2023. The key focus is on understanding the reason behind the 50.69% decline in YoY sales, identifying underperforming periods, and tracking the sales performance of various car brands. The objective is to uncover insights that can drive strategies for sales recovery.

## Steps Followed by Data Analyst to Create the Dashboard
Data Collection
Gathered and cleansed car sales data for 2022 and 2023, ensuring the data was ready for analysis by addressing any missing or inconsistent entries.

Data Modeling
Created a structured data model, establishing relationships between different tables such as sales, car makes, models, and months to facilitate dynamic reporting.

Visualization Design
Designed a three-part dashboard in Power BI:

Overall Sales Overview: Displaying total sales for 2022 and 2023 (50B and 25B, respectively), along with the YoY percentage change (-50.69%). A column chart visualizes the monthly breakdown, highlighting significant drops, such as the May 2023 drop to 200M.
Car Brand Performance: A pie chart showing the sales distribution across key brands including Honda, Chevrolet, Toyota, Ford, and Nissan.
Sales by Car Model: Area chart visualizing the sales by car models, giving insights into which models contributed most to overall sales.
Interactivity and User Experience
Added interactivity through slicers for filtering sales data by car make and year. The visualizations allow stakeholders to drill down into specific time periods and car brands for detailed insights.

Data Analysis
Leveraged Power BI's DAX formulas to compute key metrics like total sales, YoY growth, and monthly performance trends. Ensured accuracy in representing the significant decline in 2023 sales.

Insights Generation
Performed in-depth analysis to uncover the main reasons behind the YoY decline, particularly identifying that the sharp drop in May 2023 was a major contributor to the overall sales slump.

## Insights
2022 sales reached 50B, while 2023 saw a sharp decline to 25B, resulting in a -50.69% YoY drop.
May 2023 had the lowest sales at 200M, a significant drop that impacted the overall performance for the year.
Car brands like Honda, Chevrolet, Toyota, Ford, and Nissan were visualized in a pie chart, showing their respective contributions to total sales.
Certain car models outperformed others, as shown in the area chart for sales by car model, providing insights into the demand for specific models.

## Conclusion
The Car Sales Analytics Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of sales performance for 2022 and 2023, allowing stakeholders to pinpoint underperforming months and car brands. The dashboard's insights into the significant drop in sales during May 2023 enable decision-makers to explore strategies for future sales recovery.
